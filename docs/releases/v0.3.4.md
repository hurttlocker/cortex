# Cortex v0.3.4 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-20
Tag: `v0.3.4`

## Summary

`v0.3.4` promotes the audited release-candidate path to stable with additional hardening merged in the audited delta.

## Highlights

- **Search robustness for historical datasets**
  - Legacy rows with `NULL memory_class` are backfilled safely at startup.
  - Regression coverage added for keyword/semantic/hybrid mixed datasets.

- **Conflict output quality improvements**
  - Compact conflict preview defaults tightened for readability.
  - Higher-similarity conflicts are prioritized in default TTY output.

- **Audit and release gate maturity**
  - RC smoke automation and formal go/no-go handoff docs were validated pre-promotion.
  - Stable artifacts published with checksum verification.

## Audit Position

- RC audit (`v0.3.4-rc1`): **Go with Conditions**
- Delta audit (`v0.3.4-rc1..a62f11e`): **GO_WITH_CONDITIONS**
- No Critical/High findings in audited scope for promotion.

## Known Follow-through

- Operational hardening follow-up tracked post-release and completed via later v0.3.5 lane work (`cortex optimize`, SLO snapshot tooling, CI drift guard).
