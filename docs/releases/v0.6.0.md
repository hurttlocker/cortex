# Cortex v0.6.0 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-24
Tag: `v0.6.0`

## Summary

`v0.6.0` is the **cleanup and polish release** — trimming 2,144 lines of dead weight, adding import filters for precision control, and wiring auto-inference into the import pipeline. The graph explorer is now 2D-only production UI.

## Highlights

### 📥 Import Filters (`--include` / `--exclude`)
- Filter files by extension during `cortex import`: `--include .md,.txt` or `--exclude .go,.py`
- Case-insensitive, dot-optional (`.md` and `md` both work)
- Comma-separated lists for multiple extensions
- 7 new tests covering edge cases
- Prevents source code and binary files from polluting the memory corpus

### 🔗 Auto-Infer Edges on Import
- After `import --extract`, Cortex automatically runs `RunInference()` to create knowledge graph edges
- No extra step needed — facts and their relationships are created in one pass
- Skip with `--no-infer` flag when you want extraction without inference
- Prints "Inferred X new edges" on completion

### 🧹 Dead Weight Removed (-2,144 lines)
- **codexrollout** — Internal telemetry package (574 lines) that leaked into the repo. No user value.
- **observe alerts** — Removed `watch`, `alerts`, and webhook delivery CLI commands + 3 MCP tool registrations (`cortex_alerts`, `cortex_watch_add`, `cortex_watch_list`). Core `stale` and `conflicts` commands preserved in `observe` package.
- **3D graph mode** — Stripped ForceGraph3D, Three.js dependency, and all 3D-related code from the graph explorer. 2D is the production UI.
- **dist-v0.1.3** — Old release binaries removed from repo.

## Quality Evidence

- All 15 test packages passing (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Clean build (`go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/cortex`)
- Net change: -2,144 lines / +218 lines across 13 files

## Upgrade Notes

```bash
# Homebrew
brew update && brew upgrade cortex-memory

# Manual (macOS Apple Silicon)
curl -sSL https://github.com/hurttlocker/cortex/releases/download/v0.6.0/cortex-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv cortex /usr/local/bin/

# Try the new import filters
cortex import ~/notes/ --recursive --extract --include .md,.txt

# Reimport with auto-inference
cortex import ~/notes/ --recursive --extract  # edges created automatically
```

## What's Next (v0.7.0)

**Connectors are the moat.** v0.7.0 focuses on making the 5 existing connectors (GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Slack) production-ready, plus adding Discord, Telegram, and Notion connectors. See [issues labeled v0.7.0](https://github.com/hurttlocker/cortex/labels/v0.7.0) for the full roadmap.
