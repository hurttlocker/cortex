# Cortex v0.5.0 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-23
Tag: `v0.5.0`

## Summary

`v0.5.0` is the **knowledge graph release** — shipping a 2D-first interactive graph explorer, a rewritten fact extraction pipeline (92% noise reduction), and the full Connect + multi-agent infrastructure layer.

## Highlights

### 🧠 Knowledge Graph Explorer
- **2D-first visualization** with shadcn-style dark UI, 3D toggle available (#191)
- Subject graph mode — `/api/graph?subject=X` drills into a single entity's facts and edges
- Quality metadata panel — shows edge source (fact_edges_v1 vs subject_cluster fallback), density, query context
- Widened cluster API: 150 nodes default (was 50), subject range 3–200 facts (was 3–50)
- Edge deduplication, endpoint filtering, and sparse subject-cluster fallback edges
- Co-occurrence loading from `fact_cooccurrence_v1` table
- Stats banner + `/api/stats` endpoint
- Embedded Cortex branding asset

### 🔬 Fact Extraction Pipeline Rewrite
- `normalizeSubject()` strips timestamps, section trail fragments, emoji prefixes, markdown headers, parenthesized dates/times
- `MaxSubjectLength = 50` with word-boundary truncation — real entities are short, section headers are long
- `AutoCaptureGovernorConfig()` — 15 facts/memory cap, min object/predicate length 3
- Hardened `isGenericSubject()` catches timestamp-prefixed subjects, >50 char subjects, noise labels
- **Result: 301K → 23K facts** (92% noise reduction) on production corpus

### 🔗 Cortex Connect
- Connect CLI + connector framework (#138, #139)
- GitHub provider — issues, PRs, and comments (#142)
- Gmail provider via gog bridge (#142)
- Google Calendar + Drive connectors (#143)
- Slack connector + MCP connect tools + OpenClaw plugin wiring (#188, #140, #141)

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Infrastructure
- Agent namespaces — scoped facts + multi-agent views (#165)
- Shared reinforcement — implicit decay reset + cross-agent amplification (#166)
- Cross-agent conflict detection (#167)
- Fact relationship edges — knowledge graph foundation (#168)
- Co-occurrence tracking + graph traversal integration (#169)
- Relationship inference engine — emergent knowledge graph (#170)

### 🔔 Alerts & Monitoring
- Proactive fact conflict detection + alert system (#162)
- Decay notifications — fading facts alert system (#163)
- Persistent watch queries with alert notifications (#164)
- Webhook delivery channel for alerts (#187)

### 📦 Distribution
- `@cortex-ai/mcp` npm package — zero-config MCP server (#159)
- Homebrew tap auto-publish via goreleaser (#160)

## Quality Evidence

- All 15 test packages passing
- New tests: subject graph API + cluster limit enforcement
- Graph visualizer manually validated across 2D/3D modes, search, and subject drill flows

## Upgrade Notes

```bash
# Homebrew
brew update && brew upgrade cortex-memory

# Manual (macOS Apple Silicon)
curl -sSL https://github.com/hurttlocker/cortex/releases/download/v0.5.0/cortex-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv cortex /usr/local/bin/

# After upgrade — reimport to benefit from extraction improvements
cortex import ~/notes/ --recursive --extract
```

Users with existing databases should reimport to benefit from the rewritten extraction pipeline. The old noisy facts will be replaced with clean entity-relationship triples.
