# Cortex v1.2.2 — Distribution & Polish Sprint

**Released:** March 1, 2026

Ship faster, onboard smoother, fix silent killers.

## What's New

### `cortex demo` — First-Win in 30 Seconds
New users can see the full Cortex loop without bringing their own data:
```bash
cortex demo
```
Creates sample files → imports with fact extraction → searches → shows results. Uses a temp DB so it never touches your real data.

### `search --source <prefix>` — Filter by Origin
Search results can now be hard-filtered by connector source:
```bash
cortex search "API design" --source github
cortex search "meeting notes" --source obsidian
```

### Progress Output
`import` and `connect sync` now show real-time progress on stderr:
```
Importing... 42/128 files (156 facts extracted)
Done in 3.2s — 128 files, 412 facts
```

### Lifecycle Performance Fix
The reinforce-promote lifecycle policy had an O(N²) correlated subquery that caused `cortex lifecycle run` to hang indefinitely at 11K+ facts. Fixed with a CTE + JOIN rewrite. **Before:** infinite hang. **After:** 3.4 seconds for 25K+ facts.

### Shell Completions
bash/zsh/fish completions now documented in README:
```bash
cortex completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_cortex"
```

## Install / Upgrade
