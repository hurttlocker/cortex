# Cortex v0.3.5-rc1 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-20
Tag: `v0.3.5-rc1`
Status: **RC candidate (pre-audit)**

## Highlights

- **End-to-end reliability gates tightened for release quality**
  - deterministic runtime connectivity smoke: `scripts/connectivity_smoke.sh`
  - one-command auditor preflight pack: `scripts/audit_preflight.sh`
  - release checklist now requires connectivity validation before publish checks pass

- **Visualizer v1 closure (contract-first, bounded graph discipline)**
  - retrieval debug now includes BM25 + semantic + hybrid + deltas/reasons
  - bounded provenance explorer retained (`max_hops`, `max_nodes`), no global graph default
  - issue closure sequence completed for #100 → #101 → #103 → #102 → #104 → #99

- **Audit handoff readiness improved**
  - reproducible command path for go/no-go + smoke + contract validation
  - explicit evidence artifact generation for external auditor packet
  - adversarial break harness path for fresh-user destructive audit rehearsal

- **External pre-audit findings remediated**
  - symlink-loop recursive import no longer crashes (clean failure path)
  - strict rollout guard now fails when telemetry has zero valid runs
  - unreadable recursive subtree paths are surfaced as explicit import errors
  - `CORTEX_DB=~/...` and `--db ~/...` now expand to home directory
  - `cortex search --limit` now enforces safe bounds (`1..1000`)

## Included scope (high-level)

- Core release reliability lanes:
  - connectivity gate in CI/release flow
  - audit preflight script and evidence logs
- Visualizer v1 completion:
  - Retrieval Debug + Provenance Explorer closure
  - Memory Quality Engine + Reason Run Inspector already integrated in same v1 stack

## Validation commands

```bash
python3 -m py_compile scripts/visualizer_export.py scripts/visualizer_api.py scripts/validate_visualizer_contract.py
python3 scripts/validate_visualizer_contract.py
scripts/connectivity_smoke.sh
scripts/audit_rc_smoke.sh
scripts/audit_preflight.sh --tag v0.3.5-rc1
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Auditor-facing notes

- Audit target should be pinned to immutable tag: `v0.3.5-rc1`.
- Use the generated preflight report/logs from:
  - `docs/audits/v0.3.5-rc1-preflight.md`
  - `docs/audits/v0.3.5-rc1-preflight-logs/`
- Command pack: `docs/audits/v0.3.5-rc1-auditor-pack.md`

## Post-audit promotion path (planned)

1. Apply any auditor-requested fixes on top of RC branch/tag strategy.
2. Re-run preflight and smoke with immutable target.
3. Promote to stable `v0.3.5` only after GO decision and artifact revalidation.
