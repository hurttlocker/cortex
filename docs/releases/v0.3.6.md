# Cortex v0.3.6 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-21
Tag: `v0.3.6`

## Summary

`v0.3.6` ships the reason-quality closure wave from PR #130, including deterministic output-structure enforcement and guardrail-backed quality evaluation.

## Highlights

- **Reason quality now guardrail-backed in repo tooling**
  - `scripts/reason_quality_eval.py` (30-case fixture harness + artifacts)
  - `scripts/reason_guardrail_gate.py` (threshold gate)
  - `scripts/reason_outcome_rollup.py` (outcome KPI rollups)

- **Deterministic response contract enforcement**
  - Added `internal/reason/quality_contract.go` to normalize/repair thin or unstructured reason outputs.
  - Required output sections are enforced for both one-shot and recursive reason paths.

- **Recursive quality consistency improvements**
  - Recursive prompt flow now receives expanded preset templates.
  - Duplicate search handling no longer force-finalizes too early; it requests a different angle and continues.

## Quality Evidence

- Full 30-case reason quality evaluation:
  - pass rate: **0.9667** (29/30)
  - average overall score: **0.9395**
  - hard failure rate: **0.0333**
- Track 2 guardrail result: **PASS** (all checks green)
