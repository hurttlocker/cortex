# v0.3.5-rc2 Pre-Audit Go/No-Go Handoff

Date: 2026-02-20
Scope: v0.3.5-rc2 external audit readiness (release gates + visualizer v1 closure + ops maturity controls).

## Gate Checklist

### Release integrity
- [ ] `v0.3.5-rc2` pre-release published
- [ ] Assets present (darwin/linux/windows + checksums)
- [ ] One checksum spot-check completed from release assets

### Runtime behavior + reliability gates
- [ ] `scripts/connectivity_smoke.sh` passes on RC target
- [ ] `scripts/audit_rc_smoke.sh` passes on RC target
- [ ] `scripts/release_checklist.sh --tag v0.3.5-rc2` passes
- [ ] `scripts/audit_preflight.sh --tag v0.3.5-rc2` passes and emits report/logs
- [ ] `scripts/audit_break_harness.sh` passes (adversarial sanity checks)
- [ ] traversal-style visualizer export paths are rejected by default unless explicitly overridden

### Visualizer contract gates (for #99/#104 closure proof)
- [ ] `python3 scripts/validate_visualizer_contract.py` passes on RC target
- [ ] Retrieval payload includes bm25/semantic/hybrid + deltas/reasons
- [ ] Bounded graph contract includes `bounds.max_hops` + `bounds.max_nodes`

### Code health gates
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes
- [ ] `go vet ./...` passes

### Audit artifact package
- [ ] Go/no-go decision doc finalized (this file)
- [ ] Auditor command pack finalized (`docs/audits/v0.3.5-rc2-auditor-pack.md`)
- [ ] RC release notes finalized (`docs/releases/v0.3.5-rc2.md`)

## Current Decision

## ⏳ HOLD (await RC tag + artifact run)

Rationale:
- Documentation and command paths are now prepared.
- Final GO should only be declared after immutable RC tag is cut and all gate commands are run against that exact target.

## Auditor Notes

- Audit target must be immutable (`v0.3.5-rc2`) and command transcripts should reference this exact tag/commit.
- Prefer `scripts/audit_preflight.sh --tag v0.3.5-rc2` to generate reproducible, timestamped evidence artifacts.

## Owner Follow-ups

1. Cut RC tag and publish prerelease artifacts.
2. Run preflight and attach markdown + logs into audit packet.
3. Send auditor packet with pinned tag, expected outputs, and any caveats.
4. After auditor findings, apply fixes and rerun preflight before stable promotion.
