# v0.3.4-rc1 Pre-Audit Go/No-Go Handoff

Date: 2026-02-20
Scope: Pre-audit hardening + gate package readiness for external auditor.

## Gate Checklist

### Release integrity
- [x] `v0.3.4-rc1` pre-release published
- [x] Assets present (6): darwin/linux/windows tarballs + checksums
- [x] Checksum verified for `cortex-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`

### Runtime behavior gates
- [x] `cortex version` reports `0.3.4-rc1`
- [x] `cortex codex-rollout-report --help` exits `0`
- [x] strict mode fixture (`--warn-only=false`) exits `2`
- [x] strict mode fixture emits expected guardrail `WARN:` lines

### RC smoke package
- [x] `scripts/audit_rc_smoke.sh` exists and is executable
- [x] RC smoke run passed end-to-end (`go test`, `go vet`, help gate, strict gate)

### Audit-track hygiene
- [x] #60 closed (dedupe race)
- [x] #61 closed (malformed embed lock reclaim)
- [x] #62 closed (stale migration claim reclaim)
- [x] #63 closed (NULL `memory_class` hardening merged)
- [ ] #64 open (ops growth guardrails follow-through)

## Current Decision

## ✅ GO for external audit (RC)

Rationale:
- Release artifact integrity and runtime guardrail behavior are validated.
- Gate package is codified and reproducible.
- Remaining open issue (#64) is known, scoped, and explicitly tracked.

## Auditor Notes

- Audit target should be pinned to `v0.3.4-rc1` tag.
- Runtime strict mode semantics are authoritative:
  - runtime CLI returns exit `2` on guardrail warnings
  - script/go-run paths guarantee non-zero (exact code can vary by launcher)

## Owner Follow-ups After Auditor Round

1. Track #64 to closure with concrete threshold/operator defaults and maintenance runbook.
2. Promote audited candidate commit to stable (`v0.3.4`) unless new Critical/High findings emerge.
3. Continue post-release reliability wave under #74.
