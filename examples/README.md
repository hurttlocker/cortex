# Cortex Examples

Practical setups you can copy and run.

- `local-first/` — fully local workflow (Ollama + SQLite, no API keys)
- `openclaw-agent/` — MCP integration pattern for OpenClaw/Claude Code style agents
- `obsidian-sync/` — export + validate + periodic sync workflow
- `multi-agent/` — one DB, multiple agent scopes (`--agent`) with shared memory

Each directory includes a README and starter config/script files.
